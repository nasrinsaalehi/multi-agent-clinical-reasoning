    "# Extracts and normalizes patient data (structured + unstructured)\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "This notebook initializes all external and custom utilities required for the **Perception Agent**, responsible for extracting, normalizing, and preparing patient datasets. The imported modules support data reading (including compressed `.gz` files), progress tracking, serialization, and structured data handling. Together, these tools enable efficient loading, transformation, and saving of patient data into a clean training and testing dataset in `.csv` format.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inputs\n",
    "- Modules enable access to:\n",
    "  - Raw patient data files (`.csv`, `.gz`).\n",
    "  - The main dataset used for the training phase and validation is [MIMIC-IV Clinical Database Demo](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii-demo/1.4/) which is a open access dataset. MIMIC-IV is comprised of deidentified electronic health records for patients admitted to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Access to MIMIC-IV is limited to credentialed users. Here, we have provided an openly available demo of MIMIC-IV containing a subset of 100 patients.\n",
    "  - Utility functions defined in `utils.py` for data extraction, normalization, or cleaning.\n",
    "- Assumes that:\n",
    "  - The working directory contains a `utils.py` file.\n",
    "  - Required dependencies (`tqdm`, `dill`, `jsonlines`, etc.) are installed."
