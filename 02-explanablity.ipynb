    "# Test the Explainability of the model for sample data extracted from the database\n",
    "This cell builds a set of stringification helper functions that convert structured clinical data — such as ICD diagnosis codes, lab results, medication orders, and admission metadata — into natural-language sentences. These functions form the foundation of the Explainability Agent, allowing the system to describe patient encounters in human-readable text rather than raw database codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concretely:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It defines templates to turn ICD codes (diagnoses), lab results, medication orders, and admission details into narrative text.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The stringify_visit() function integrates these elements into a full patient summary, providing a coherent paragraph describing an encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The final block (under if __name__ == '__main__':) demonstrates how each function generates readable summaries from sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In the context of the assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "This code operationalizes the Explainability Agent’s role — translating structured hospital data into clinician-friendly narratives that explain what the system “sees” and “thinks.”\n",
    "\n",
    "It prepares the groundwork for generating explanations agent.\n"
